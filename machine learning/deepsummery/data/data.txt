I read last Saturday in theredwoods outside of Santa Cruzand I was about 3/4's finishedwhen I heard a long high screamand a quite attractive young girl came running toward melong gown & divine eyes of fireand she leaped up on the stageand screamed: "I WANT YOU!I WANT YOU! TAKE  ME! TAKEME!"I told her, "look, get the hellaway from me."but she kept tearing at myclothing and throwing herselfat me."where were you," Iasked her, "when I was livingon one candy bar a day andsending short stories to theAtlantic Monthly?"she grabbed my balls and almosttwisted them off. her kissestasted like shitsoup.2 women jumped up on the stageandcarried her off into thewoods.I could still hear her screams as I began the next poem.mabye, I thought, I should havetaken her on stage in frontof all those eyes.but one can never be surewhether it's good poetry orbad acid.
